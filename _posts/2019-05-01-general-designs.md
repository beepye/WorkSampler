For quick reference to a somewhat eclectic mix of design work you can check out my [Dribbble profile](https://dribbble.com/beepye). It contains everything from logo work, UI wireframes for components, to t-shirt designs.

The CMO wanted to display testimonials on destination and product pages. I designed and developed a carousel component and we initially launched it under the "Add A Review" tab on the product pages. We eventually put the carousel on the destination pages under the How It Works section (it is no longer there now).

The company needed an updated 404 page - the old one still had the old branding and we were getting ready to do some tech migrations that would black out the site several times during the week.

### [Build Your Own Video](https://www.smartdestinations.com/boston-attractions-and-tours/_ptd_Bos-p1.html)

![BYO Video](/images/video-location.png)

We had videos made by a 3rd party to help clarify what our passes are/what we do. Figuring out a location for them in the UI and implementing the video components fell in my hands. I performed some minimal user tests on usertesting.com to assess which location got the most clicks/was noticed the most on for both mobile and desktop.

This was a quick design and dev job for a local furniture boutique in Waltham. I was limited to working within the SquareSpace template's flexibility and the owners requests (which I didn't always agree with but y'know how that goes).
