### [First In Tree Services](http://firstintreeservices.com/)

![First In Tree Services]({{ site.url }}/WorkSampler/assets/images/first-in.png)

I did a complete rebrand for this tree services company in Virgina. All of our meetings were virtual (GoToMeeting) making constant communication key. The website I threw in as a bonus for them as they were running a Wix template and it was pretty ugly (_really_ ugly). The forms don't work so please forgive me for that, my hands are tied until the owner takes care of some things on his end.

The Github repo containing all of the work lives [here](https://github.com/beepye/F.I.T.S.) and the designs specifically are [here](https://github.com/beepye/F.I.T.S./tree/master/DESIGN%20FILES).

Some of the work can be found in my [Dribbble profile](https://dribbble.com/beepye) as well.
