Hey! My name’s Brian, but most folks call me BP. I’m a front end dev with an eye for design who enjoys straddling the fence between both design and development.

I live outside of Boston in the small town of Ashland with my wonderful and loving wife, 2 adorable daughters, and a bull-headed bulldog who emphasizes the breed’s stubborn nature. When not working you can find me (hopefully not actually find me) somewhere outdoors covered in dirt, casting a line, treading trails, and plucking strings.

I find beauty in simplicity and try to reflect that in what I do. If you have a project that needs some attention feel free to contact me and we can further discuss it.

Cheers!
